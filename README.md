# AutoTechnician_Halfords
This purpose it to help/improve the Auto/Audio Technician role at Halfords. From personal experience I have found trying to get tech parts to be a little tedious. The description provided isn't clear along with no longer being able to order in as many parts as possible increases the difficulty of the job. but improve to be similar to paint systems
