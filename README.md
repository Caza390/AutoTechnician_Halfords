# AutoTechnician_Halfords
This purpose it to help/improve the Auto/Audio Technician role at Halfords. From personal experience I have found trying to get tech parts to be a little tedious. The description provided isn't clear along with no longer being able to order in as many parts as possible increases the difficulty of the job. I also wanted to make something similar to the auto paint trade which used a voting like system on common colours, user recommendation and to try and keep updated with the back order issues.
